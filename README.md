The Data set Link :- https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset
And You can Download the trained model from following link :- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YGW0WUhULQ_yhoVT_LtT9DH2WSG-Tn7z/view?usp=sharing


Here Is the complete guide for Implementing this project 
1. Download the code uploaded here or you can use the ipynb jupyter file for reference and build your own model
2. If you are not building your own model, you can dowmload the pre trained model from the Google drive link present above
3. Once you have the model, implement the main.py file in any python Integrated IDE such as Spyder, Pycharm etc.
4. After the implementation when you run the file live camera will be opened and it will classify the face emotions




Thank You!!
